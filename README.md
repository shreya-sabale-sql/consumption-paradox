# The Consumption Paradox (2014–2024)
### Why people kept spending more even as money became more expensive

In the last decade, inflation rose, income inequality widened, and geopolitical risk increased — yet consumer spending continued to grow.

This project investigates **how that was possible.**

Using macroeconomic data from the **World Bank**, **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)**, and national accounts, I test whether rising **credit** — not income — became the hidden engine of consumption.

## 🔍 Core Question

**Did credit replace income as the main driver of consumption?**

## 📊 What I Did

- Collected global and Indian macroeconomic data  
- Cleaned and standardized it in **Excel**  
- Calculated growth rates and correlations in **PostgreSQL**  
- Built interactive dashboards in **Power BI**  
- Documented the full analytical journey in a **video series**

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Real consumption kept rising even during inflationary shocks  
- Household and private credit expanded faster than income  
- Countries with higher credit-to-GDP ratios showed stronger consumption growth  
- In India, rising household debt coincided with higher inequality and continued spending  

This suggests that modern consumption is increasingly **debt-driven**, not income-driven — creating a fragile growth model.
